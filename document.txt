problem statement


Okay, here's a refined problem statement incorporating the points we've discussed:

Problem Statement:

Truist relies heavily on APIs to deliver critical services and ensure a seamless customer experience. However, the current approach to API monitoring presents several challenges:

Reactive Issue Detection: API issues are often identified reactively, through customer complaints or system errors, leading to delayed responses, service disruptions, and potential damage to Truist's reputation.
Inefficient Manual Testing: Manual API health checks are time-consuming, prone to human error, and not scalable to accommodate the growing number of APIs. This approach diverts valuable resources from other critical tasks.
Limited Performance Visibility: The lack of comprehensive monitoring hinders Truist's ability to gain insights into API performance trends, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation.
Risk of Inaccurate Load Testing: Conducting load tests without prior health checks can lead to misleading results, as underlying API issues may be misinterpreted as performance bottlenecks.
These challenges highlight the need for a proactive, automated, and comprehensive API monitoring solution like AppHealthWatch. By addressing these problems, AppHealthWatch enables Truist to:

Proactively identify and resolve API issues before they impact customers.
Improve service reliability and uptime.
Enhance customer satisfaction.
Optimize load testing processes.
Gain valuable insights into API performance.
This ultimately contributes to Truist's digital transformation goals and strengthens its position in the market.
